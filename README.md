##API Key Hiding (`api_key.txt`)

To make sure that my own YouTube Data API key was not published,
I separated it into a text file (`api_key.txt`) and used `.gitignore` to ensure that it wasn't published.

If you wish to do this yourself, you must

1. [Get your own API key from Google](http://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started#intro).
2. Put this key in a file entitled `api_key.txt`.
3. Put this file in the same directory as `youtube_integration.py`.


##Enjoy!
